AI Mood-Based Playlist Generator

Project Description

This project is a back-end application for a mood-based playlist generator. It is designed to interpret a user's mood using Gemini AI and then create a personalized music playlist from Spotify and Apple Music APIs. The application supports user authentication and persistent storage of playlist history using MongoDB and Clerk.

âœ¨ Features

User Authentication: Secure user authentication is handled by Clerk.

Mood-based Playlist Generation: Accepts a mood description from the user to generate a playlist. (Note: The core logic for API calls to Gemini, Spotify, and Apple Music is a placeholder in the provided code).

Playlist History: Allows authenticated users to view their past generated playlists.

Shareable Playlists: Publicly accessible routes to share individual playlists with anyone, regardless of their login status.

Database Integration: Utilizes MongoDB to store and manage user-specific data, including playlist history.

API Management: Handles API keys and credentials securely on the server-side.
